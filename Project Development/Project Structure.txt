Working on programming project

1. Identify the problem
    - Not able to keep track of work application
    - Dont know what item do I have, and keep on spending to buy the same item

2. Have a plan
    - what tech stack to use
    - what database to use
    - what backend gonna look likes
    - what fronend gonna look likes
    - general components that gonna use

3. Directory and folder structure
    - depends on framework
    Tips:
    - be consistent (eg. name-name, nameName, name_name) | plural keeps on plural
    - dont jammed up root directory (eg. design-files, apps(backend, frontend, libs(helper, types)), github-stuffs)

4. Use version control
    Steps:
    - Initialize git repo
    - Add different files
    - Write meaningful commit message

5. Modularize and componentize the project
    - Dont write single file of 1000 lines code
    - Modularize its

6. Documentation
    - Installation or troubleshooting guide (Document any issue found when using in any different env)
    - Briefly tell user: How do they run the code, what do they need(keys, special access, contact admin etc)
    - Documents of all issue and solutions

7. Testing
    - To have proper full software development
    - Unit test, intergration test, end2end test

8. Dependency management
    - Secure, updated, maintained

9. Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment
    - Deployed in environment
    - Help other to run the application easily
    - eg. Deployed on container, website just one click away with url, installation folder bundled up
    - Deployed and how secure it is
