LLM Response:
 Scammers use tactics like impersonation and deepfakes to trick people into giving up their bank information. They might pretend to be bank employees or government officials—often using AI-generated video or audio that looks and sounds legitimate—to create a sense of urgency and fear. For example, they may call or email you, claiming that immediate action is needed to avoid severe consequences, or even impersonate a family member in distress. Once you’re under pressure, you might inadvertently provide your sensitive details or authorize a payment, allowing the scammers to access your bank account information.
