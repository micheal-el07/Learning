### **Recognition Tips**:  
1. **Unexpected High-Pressure Demands**: Scammers often create urgency, demanding immediate payment or action to avoid consequences (e.g., threats of legal action, account closure, or claims of a family member in distress).  
2. **Suspicious Communication Channels**: Be wary of unsolicited calls, emails, or video calls—especially if they request sensitive information, payments, or one-time passcodes. Phone numbers and caller IDs can be spoofed to appear legitimate.  
3. **Deepfake Red Flags**: Video or audio that seems slightly "off" (e.g., unnatural gestures, voice mismatches, or blurry visuals). For example, fraudsters have used deepfakes to impersonate company executives during fake video calls to authorize fraudulent transfers.  
4. **Emotional Exploitation**: Extortion scams may involve calls mimicking a family member’s voice claiming to be in danger, leveraging fear to bypass rational judgment.  

### **Avoidance Strategies**:  
1. **Pause and Verify**: Do not act immediately. Hang up or close the message and contact the organization or individual directly using a trusted method (e.g., official website, phone number from your bank statement, or a pre-saved contact).  
2. **Validate Identities**:  
   - If a caller claims to be from a bank (e.g., J.P. Morgan), hang up and call back via an official number. **Never share one-time passcodes**.  
   - For government officials, avoid intimidation tactics—verify via the agency’s official contact details.  
3. **Create a Family Protocol**: Establish a “safe word” to confirm identities during distress calls. If a “family member” claims an emergency, call another trusted relative before sending money.  
4. **Question Everything**: Assume no digital interaction is inherently genuine. Double-check requests for payments or sensitive data, even if they appear to come from a known contact.  

By staying skeptical, refusing to comply under pressure, and independently verifying identities, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to AI-driven impersonation scams.
